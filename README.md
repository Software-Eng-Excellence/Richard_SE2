ðŸŽ‚ UML-Based Cake Ordering System

This repository contains the UML design and implementation of a Items Ordering System with support for different storage formats (CSV, JSON, XML, SQLite) and extensible repositories for managing cakes, books, and toys.

ðŸ“Œ UML Diagrams
1. Mapper & Storage UML

This diagram shows how data is mapped between different formats (CSV, JSON, XML, SQLite) and the systemâ€™s domain objects.

IMapper Interface â†’ Defines map() and reverse() for converting between data and objects.

Specialized Mappers â†’ CSVCakeMapper, JSONBookMapper, XMLToyMapper, etc.

SQLite Mappers â†’ Handle persistence in relational DB for Cake and Order.

2. Repository & Builder UML

This diagram shows how orders, cakes, books, and toys are represented and managed using repositories and the builder pattern.

Repository Layer â†’ Provides create, get, update, delete operations.

Domain Models â†’ CakeModel, BookModel, ToyModel, Order.

Builders â†’ CakeBuilder, BookBuilder, ToyBuilder for object creation.

Identifiable Entities â†’ Each item (Cake, Book, Toy) can be tracked with unique IDs.

ðŸš€ Features

Multiple storage mappers: CSV, JSON, XML, SQLite.

Flexible repository system with interfaces for easy extension.

Builder pattern for constructing objects step by step.

Clear separation of concerns between persistence, domain models, and builders.
